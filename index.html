        <h2>Introducing the: GUJJU PUNJU'S</h2>
<br>
<!-----    <IMG SRC=" ALIGN="right" >    -------->
<p>
The "Gujju Punjus" is a quirky and comical football team in The Masala League, known for their distinctive and humorous playing styles. Here's a description of their key players:

<br>
<br>
G. Gul Jasim Shah: Often called the "Headmaster" of the team, G. Gul Jasim Shah is a player who exclusively uses his head to play football. He's remarkably skilled at headers and can score goals with astonishing accuracy using his cranium. His headbutts are the talk of the league, and he's a true master of heading the ball in style.

<br>
<br>
Lil Samosa: Lil Samosa is a player whose heart is in sponsorship and brand deals rather than on the field. He's constantly seen sporting various logos and products, and his main goal is to secure the most lucrative endorsements. While his skills may not be top-notch, his jersey is always covered in advertisements.

<br>
<br>
Rishi Sunak: Rishi Sunak is a player who faces an unusual predicament every match â€“ he gets diarrhea due to his love for spicy sambar. Despite frequent bathroom breaks, he's a tenacious midfielder who gives his all on the pitch, even if it occasionally leads to some "explosive" situations.


<br>
<br>
Singh: Singh is the team's versatile player who uses lassi as his sports drink of choice. He believes that the creamy drink gives him the energy he needs to tackle opponents. After every successful tackle, he celebrates with a lassi toast, ensuring he stays hydrated and entertained throughout the match.
<br>
<br>
Syed al Qaeda: This player's name often raises eyebrows, but his "suicidal tackles" are the stuff of legend. Syed has an unconventional and fearless approach to defense, often making tackles that leave both opponents and spectators in shock. He's known for being the "Brexit Buster" on the team, and he's always up for a no-holds-barred challenge.

<br>
<br>
The Gujju Punjus are a source of entertainment and amusement in The Masala League, bringing a unique and hilarious twist to the world of football with their eccentric players and playing styles.
